### Introduction

This project is a continuation of [Flytte project](https://github.com/Flytte/flytte), the main purpose of which is to create an intuitive application for controlling flying drones. The application consists of a UI that employs augmented reality features, ANNs for drone's pose recognition and a core, based on ROS, that is responsible for communication with the drone as well as all the necessary computations. This repository consists of augmentation of the work done in [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05641), and a corresponding repository, from which this repo is forked, which can be used for drone's orientation recognition in the project.
